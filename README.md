# Geaux's Random Quote Generator

Created a random quote generator to showcase my vanilla JavaScript skills - no freakin UI framework or nuthin'! Vanilla JS is the best flavor of JavaScript baby!

## To Start this project

Umm yeah, so if you don't want to just like, read quotes then do this:

```
git clone https://github.com/geauxweisbeck4/Quote-Generator
cd Quote-Generator
node index.html
```

I think... I dunno I just deployed it to Netlify!

You can also just edit it below on StackBlitz... much easier...
